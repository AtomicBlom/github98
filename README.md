# GitHub '98
If GitHub were an operating system around the year '98, it would probably look like this.

This theme was inspired by twitter user [@nikitonsky](http://twitter.com/nikitonsky), who upon learning Microsoft was buying GitHub, created a mockup of a Windows 98 theme.

[So I heard $MSFT is buying @GitHub](https://twitter.com/nikitonsky/status/1003593821723267072)

With his permission, I've tried my best to implement his mockups, because I kinda want my github like this too.
